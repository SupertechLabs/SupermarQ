    Transverse Field Ising Models (TFIM) of variable length.

    Device performance is based on how closely the experimentally obtained
    average magnetization (along the Z-axis) matches the noiseless value.
    Since the 1D TFIM is efficiently simulatable with classical algorithms,
    computing the noiseless average magnetization remains scalable over a large
